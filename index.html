                    Hi, I am Riyansh, and being in seventh grade is pretty awesome!
                    I love spending my afternoons coding—there's something amazing about creating my own games or apps.
                    It feels like magic when I see my ideas come to life on the screen!
                    But when I am not coding, you can find me on the soccer field, where I feel free and alive.
                    I love the rush of dribbling past defenders and scoring goals with my friends. I also live in
                    Canada, Ontario, Ottawa
                    Balancing my two passions—coding and soccer—makes every day an adventure. I can't wait to see where
                    both of these interests will take me!
